      <p className="text-4xl font-bold">​​​​​Welcome to Bookless Bookclub! 📚</p>
      <p>
        ​​​Each Tuesday evening, we gather the most curious and thoughtful
        people in Austin to read together and talk about it. All genres welcome!
      </p>
      <p>
        ​​​Bookless Bookclub isn’t just about what you’re reading. It’s not even
        about a single book or genre. It’s about creating connections around the
        topics you love.
      </p>
      <p>
        ​Bring whatever you want to read, in whatever format. It could be a
        book, a newspaper, a scientific article. It could even be a letter from
        your grandma. Shout out Nana!
      </p>
      <p>​Parking is across the street on Toomey Rd.</p>

      <p>
        <b>​​​6:20-6:30 pm:</b> Meet outside, get to know your neighbors.
